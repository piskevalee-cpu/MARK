## 🚀 What is MARK?

Mark is a personal, persistent, and intelligent assistant that lives entirely in your terminal. 
It combines the power of state-of-the-art LLMs (Google Gemini & Groq) with a local, secure memory system. 

**The coolest feature?** Local Memory.
If you tell Mark something, he remembers it forever (saved locally on your machine).

```text
> remember that my preferred language is Python
✅ I will remember: "my preferred language is Python"

> write a script to sort a list
(Mark writes the script in Python automatically because he remembers!)
```

Mark's memory is **100% local**. No data brokers, no cloud storage of your personal facts.

## 🧠 The Kleos System

Kleos is Mark's advanced capabilities engine. It transforms Mark from a simple chatbot into a reasoning agent.

**Why use `/kleos`?**
Standard LLMs often rush to answer, missing context or nuance. Kleos forces a "Think before you speak" workflow.

### How it works:
1. **Analyze**: You provide a prompt. Kleos analyzes it for ambiguity, missing context, or hidden requirements.
2. **Refine**: It acts as an expert "Prompt Engineer", rewriting your query to be logically perfect.
3. **Execute**: It sends the optimized prompt to the AI.

**Result**: Drastically higher quality answers, better code, and deeper insights.

**Usage:**
```bash
/kleos Explain how to build a neural network from scratch
```
*(Mark will pause, analyze your request, optimize the internal prompt, and then deliver a superior tutorial)*
